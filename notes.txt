What ive doen is essentially a mini physics simulator for 2d boxes. Might as well finish it properly


Things to add:
	1: Add a proper timer step.
	2: Add mass to squares and adjust thier velocities properly with mass inclucde
	3: Add a friction and restitution into the solver



TODO FIXES:
	I think x and y velocites keep running on some conditions so maybe something to subtract a small bit from velocity until its 0.
